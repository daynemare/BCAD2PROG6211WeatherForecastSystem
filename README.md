# BCAD2PROG6211WeatherForecastSystem
A weather forecasting software system written in C# .Net Framework I was assigned to develop for a Portfolio of Evidence for my PROG6211 programming module. 
This was developed during my 2nd year of my Bachelors in Application Development degree in 2019. The final submission of this project was graded 90 out of 100.
